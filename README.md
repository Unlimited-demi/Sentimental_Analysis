## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/unlimited-demi/sentiment-analysis.git
 
2. Install the requirements:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Follow the steps below to preprocess the data, train the model, and perform sentiment analysis.

4. Preprocessing:
- Place your dataset file in the  data directory
- Update the file paths in the code accordingly.
- Training the Model
Run the training script:

- python train_model.py

- The trained model and vectorizer will be saved as sentiment_model.pkl and vectorizer.pkl, respectively.

- Performing Sentiment Analysis
Place the data to analyze in the data directory.

- Update the file paths in the code accordingly.

- Run the sentiment analysis script:

- python sentiment_analysis.py
- The predictions will be saved as predicted_sentiment.csv.

5. Evaluation: 
- Compare the predictions in predicted_sentiment.csv with the original labels in your dataset to evaluate the model's performance.


6. Contributing:

- Contributions are welcome! If you have any ideas, suggestions, or bug fixes, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
